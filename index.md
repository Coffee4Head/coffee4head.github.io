## Research Interests - EECS

- Design Automation
- Domain Specific Compiler
- Architecture Modeling and DSE
- Hardware Accelerator

My current research focuses on **design automation** that fully exploits the hardware potential, particularly in the field of **artificial intelligence**. In a word, as AI models continue to grow crazy, I aim to contribute my talents to bridge the gap between automation tools and expert-designed hardware.
